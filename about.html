						<td><p class="speech-bubble-a">I'm a self taught developer based out of Ann Arbor. While I specialize mostly in front end dev, I'm majoring in CS (Programming in Java) and I'm learning the ropes of game development at the same time.</p></td>

					<tr>
						<td><p class="speech-bubble-a">I'm not really in the business of settling. I'd rather spend my time being productive and learning than stagnating.</p></td>

						<td><p class="speech-bubble-a">Not only am I self sufficient, I'm pretty good at what I do. I'm going to college to fill in the gaps and become even better.</p></td>

						<td><p class="speech-bubble-q">That's all pretty cool, but we should probably see <br>if you're a 'cultural fit' for the company.</p></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><p class="speech-bubble-a">Yeah, that's completely fair. If you check out the home page, you'll see a quick list of the stuff that's gotten my attention lately. It's not a subsitute for a face to face conversation, but it's a good start.</p></td>
